**When you make one of these changes, add replace -[ ] with -[X] and commit this file.**

- [ ] Re-write the code to avoid using the `calc_node_root_distances` because right now your code assumes that the output of this function is the same traversal as `preorder_node_iter` but if this wasn't the case your output would break (for example if this was updated in future versions of dendropy). Also, it is useful to modify the tree structure to have new variables.
- [ ] Instead of printing the tree, maybe write the tree to an output file that can be specifying args (`-i` for input and `-o` for output). Otherwise, maybe print the file using `sys.stdout.write` to make sure that it goes to standard output and can be piped (`|`) and written to a file (`>`).
- [ ] Use `if __name__ == "__main__":` and `main` functions and a separate function that does the work so that your script can be excuted from the command line or imported into a different python script or module --- baically this will make your code more reusable.
