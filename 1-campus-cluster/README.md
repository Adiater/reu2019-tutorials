Tutorial 1: Campus Cluster
==========================
**If you are in Champaign, you should be working on this assignment as a group between 3-6pm in 3401 Siebel Center. Although you may work together, each of you should write and commit your own script to Github. Message the group slack in channel #tutorials with any questions/issues.**
