Tutorial 1: Campus Cluster
==========================
**If you are in Champaign, you should be working on this assignment as a group between 3-6pm in 3401 Siebel Center. Although you may work together, each of you should write and commit your own script to Github. Message the group slack in channel #tutorials with any questions/issues.**

In order to complete this assignment, you will need to access the Campus Cluster remotely. If you are using a Windows system, you may need to download an application for this purpose. If you are using a Mac or Linux system, then you can remotely access the Campus Cluster; just open the terminal the [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) application and type

```
ssh [YourNetId]@golub.campuscluster.illinois.edu
```

To see your present working directory, type

```
pwd
```

The output should be your home directory on the Campus Cluster: `/home/[YourNetID]`.
