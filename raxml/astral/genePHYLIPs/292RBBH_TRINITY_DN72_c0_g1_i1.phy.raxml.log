WARNING: You might be using too many threads (2) for your alignment with 83 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.
