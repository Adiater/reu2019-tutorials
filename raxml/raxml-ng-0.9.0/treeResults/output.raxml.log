Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 83 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: GTR+FO+G4m
Alignment sites / patterns: 83 / 83
Gaps: 9.64 %
Invariant sites: 0.00 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: treeResults/output.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (2) for your alignment with 83 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.
