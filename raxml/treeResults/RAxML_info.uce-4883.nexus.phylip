IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_rubriceps_lsu265 and piranga_leucoptera_lsu7783 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_rubriceps_lsu265 and piranga_rubriceps_lsu34818 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences piranga_rubra_sdsu2654 and piranga_rubra_sdsu2635 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file uce_phylip/uce-4883.nexus.phylip.reduced
