IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences catreus_wallichi and lophura_inornata are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences catreus_wallichi and perdix_dauuricae are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-2384.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
