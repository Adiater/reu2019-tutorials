IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and lophura_inornata are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences cyrtonyx_montezumae and melgal2 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences lophura_nycthemera and lophura_swinhoii are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences lophura_nycthemera and perdix_dauuricae are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 4 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-5978.fasta.reduced
