IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences catreus_wallichi and chrysolophus_pictus are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-1463.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"

WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 12.959410 estimated by RAxML for partition number 0 with the name "No Name Provided"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!
