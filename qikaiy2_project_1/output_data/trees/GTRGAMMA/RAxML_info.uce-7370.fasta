IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and lophophorus_impejanus are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and lophura_nycthemera are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-7370.fasta.reduced

WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 12.942144 estimated by RAxML for partition number 0 with the name "No Name Provided"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!
