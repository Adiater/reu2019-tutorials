IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences chrysolophus_pictus and lophura_nycthemera are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences chrysolophus_pictus and phasianus_colchicus are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences crossoptilon_crossoptilon and perdix_dauuricae are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-5827.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
