IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 4 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-3857.fasta.reduced

Alignment has 48 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 9.89%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
