IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences phasianus_colchicus and syrmaticus_reevesii are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file ../input_data/aligns/tackle_data/uce-5251.fasta.reduced
